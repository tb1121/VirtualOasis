## About

Have you ever wanted to travel back to the 90s and relax with some laid-back tunes and simplistic but snappy apps? Relive the glory days of 90s computing and kick back in the Virtual Oasis. The Virtual Oasis was designed to emulate Windows 95 in a clean and fun way so you can feel good, while looking good too.

Enjoy some music in the Tunes app while you search Google, plan your next events in the Calendar app, and perform calculations on a retro calculator with a backlight! Take notes in your next meeting and save them with just a click in the notes app!
